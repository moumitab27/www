Examples range from problems of mainstream interest (such as filter bubbles and 'extremification'), to more subtle forms of unfairness, such as the loss of utility felt by users whose demographics are poorly represented by marketing content. I'll also discuss various strategies to mitigate these undesired effects, by adapting ideas from 'fair ML' to recommendation scenarios.","talk_title":"The Consequences of Personalized Machine Learning","title":"Prof."},{"UID":"2","bio":"David is a Principal Applied Scientist at Amazon, Israel and an ACM\nDistinguished Engineer.

The recent advances in neural network technologies\nmake them effective and easily extendable to various tasks, including\nretrieval and recommendation. This raises the possibility of jointly\nmodeling and optimizing search ranking and recommendation algorithms,\nwith potential benefits to both. In this talk, I will highlight\nchallenges we face in joint modeling of search and recommendation as\nwell as the opportunities it introduces, such as improving model\ngeneralization, interpretability, and explainability.
