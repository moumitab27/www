Examples range from problems of mainstream interest (such as filter bubbles and 'extremification'), to more subtle forms of unfairness, such as the loss of utility felt by users whose demographics are poorly represented by marketing content. I'll also discuss various strategies to mitigate these undesired effects, by adapting ideas from 'fair ML' to recommendation scenarios.","talk_title":"The Consequences of Personalized Machine Learning","title":"Prof."},{"UID":"2","bio":"Hamed Zamani is an Assistant Professor in the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he also serve as the Associate Director of the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR).
