That capability can be used in personalized search, conversational search, and producing grounding text for large language models (LLMs). This talk covers some recent work on the fundamentals (MS MARCO) and additional capabilities needed for personalization and conversation (including \"A theoretical model of conversational search\" by Radlinski and Craswell). For each published work, it then presents toy examples generated by GPT-4 (dv3). The toy examples help us speculate about the impact of LLMs on previous research directions.","talk_title":"Personalization and Conversation (and GPT-4)","title":""},{"UID":"2","bio":"Ed H.

She is interested in Intelligent Systems, particularly next-generation capabilities for digital assistants, including spoken conversational search, collection of complex datasets, and task progression through ubiquitous sensing. She is also working with Ambulance Victoria, using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify cardiac arrest emergency calls efficiently. She has built an international reputation as a leader in conversational information-seeking research, especially at the intersection of conversational systems, interactive information retrieval (IIR), human-computer interaction (HCI), and dialogue analysis, with the aim of making information more accessible. Johanne is currently part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) program committee and is an ACM Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval (CHIIR) steering committee member.
