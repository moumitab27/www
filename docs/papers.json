[{"TLDR":"\nWe present a multi pronged personalization strategy for e-commerce search by incorporating high dimensional representations of user and item interactions. We explore and evaluate two major application sub-domains of search science: query expansion and ranking. The former deals with personalizing at the query level by augmenting queries with users\u2019 item condition preferences. Our proposed methodology empirically shows almost 0.7% gain in relevance measures for some class of queries. While the later approach influences the ranking models with personalized factors. This is done by building a multioutput regression model to quantify the purchase price affinity for an user, which is utilized as a factor by the ranking models complementing its standard set of predictors. Offline evaluation for the price affinity model exhibits 35% reduction in price estimates error compared to the baseline method.","UID":"1","abstract":"\nWe present a multi pronged personalization strategy for e-commerce search by incorporating high dimensional representations of user and item interactions.
