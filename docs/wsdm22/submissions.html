              <b>Abstract:</b> 
We present a multi pronged personalization strategy for e-commerce search by incorporating high dimensional representations of user and item interactions. We explore and evaluate two major application sub-domains of search science: query expansion and ranking. The former deals with personalizing at the query level by augmenting queries with users‚Äô item condition preferences. Our proposed methodology empirically shows almost 0.7% gain in relevance measures for some class of queries. While the later approach influences the ranking models with personalized factors. This is done by building a multioutput regression model to quantify the purchase price affinity for an user, which is utilized as a factor by the ranking models complementing its standard set of predictors. Offline evaluation for the price affinity model exhibits 35% reduction in price estimates error compared to the baseline method.

              <b>Abstract:</b> E-commerce is becoming the largest retail channel in the world. With more and more consumers are buying retail goods online including essentials, groceries, household supplies, big electronics, etc, more and more sellers now register and sell products through e-marketplaces platforms. With the significantly increased online consumers transactions and larger collection of product assortments, there is a need for e-markerplace sellers to making the right product picks and ordering the right quantities to match products‚Äô demand.
In this work, we utilize the signals of product features of seller and competitor obtained from in-network as well as from out-of-network, build multi-target deep learning model to produce the personalized demand ranking of a given product at different granularity for our seller: in-network rank, ROM rank and overall rank. We tackle this problem in these steps: First, we obtain matched items 2 from in-network and ROM by running our owned item matching model. Second, matched items and the correspondent sellers‚Äô listing information are used as training set for our multi-target deep learning model to learn the normalized rank score for a given product listed by a seller. Third, model inferences this given item and generates demand rank, which is used as gauging the popularity of the product and provide personalized recommendation to fill the assortment gap for seller.
Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate our proposed multi-target deep learning approach by applying regression and classification metrics, etc. The experiments show our proposed approach achieves high accuracy, low MSE and high ùëÖ2. Additionally, we validate that multi-target approach outperforms single-target approach.

              <b>Abstract:</b> As Recommendation systems are adopted for many different domains with success stories, multiple different vertical recommendation systems are often built. Meta Platform Inc. (previously known
as Facebook) and Amazon are examples that provides multiple services to their users. Those services within a company are often time
using different backend systems to focus on their vertical experiences and to facilitate the development processes. Those paradigm
implies that a vertical recommendation system would not take advantages of utilizing signals with respect to cross-products and
multi-modality. However, it is not trivial to build a framework to
utilize signals from cross-products, due to the scale involved with
the user sizes and content volumes as well as dynamics of content
updates. To address this, we present a novel framework that collects
signals from cross-products by considering low latency, allowing a
vertical recommendation system to realize interactions from other
products fast. In addition, we present a novel modeling approach
in representing signals in heterogenous modality in order to enable
to quantify ‚Äúrelatedness‚Äù or ‚Äúsimilarity‚Äù to be mapped for vertical
specific entities ‚Äì that is, signals from cross-products are initially
collected in a free text format since they are queried for searching.
And those search signals are modeled to represent for quantifying
similarity with videos, which is our focused domain for this paper.
Our approach using bi-partite graph in modeling heterogenous
signals, search queries, for personalized video recommendation
system has shown effective outcomes. Online A/B test showed that
our approach can statistically significantly improve our top line
metrics in terms of watch time, etc.

              <b>Abstract:</b> Autocomplete is a common practice in the search engine for E-commerce. A successful application of Autocomplete requires an understanding of search context. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning based reranking framework with the capacity to consume real-time contextual information but without adding any latency. We also introduce Absolute Mean Reciprocal Rank(AMRR), a variation of Mean Reciprocal Rank(MRR) to evaluate Autocomplete ranking. The reranking framework shows $+17.2\%$ AMRR lift in offline evaluation. It is currently served on Walmart.com as a key component to improve customers search experience.

<h1>Call For Papers</h1>
<p>Personalization has been a prevalent concept in the context of recommender systems. And the Web Search engines such as Google and Bing have been incorporating user intents and context to show different ranked lists of results for different users for the same query.  Furthermore, in recent years, we are seeing widespread usage of personalization and recommendations in search. Examples of personalized search include e-commerce sites like Etsy.com, Music search on Spotify, restaurants search on UberEats, talent search on LinkedIn etc. showing different users‚Äô different relevant results for the same query. These applications indicate how valuable personalization has been in the context of search. Similarly we find recommendations adding value to search beyond typical retrieval and ranking approaches. In this workshop, we want to bring all such applications and approaches developed to incorporate personalization and recommendation in search algorithms.</p>

Please note that for the scope of this workshop both personalization and/or recommendations are for improving search experience. Personalization or recommendations as stand-alone topics are out of the scope for this workshop. We also welcome work that can highlight the challenges faced in developing a search algorithm with personalization in real production systems.
