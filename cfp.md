# Call For Papers

Personalization has been a prevalent concept in the context of recommender systems. And the Web Search engines such as Google and Bing have been incorporating user intents and context to show different ranked lists of results for different users for the same query.  Furthermore, in recent years, we are seeing widespread usage of personalization and recommendations in search. Examples of personalized search include e-commerce sites like Etsy.com, Music search on Spotify, restaurants search on UberEats, talent search on LinkedIn etc. showing different users’ different relevant results for the same query. These applications indicate how valuable personalization has been in the context of search. Similarly we find recommendations adding value to search beyond typical retrieval and ranking approaches. In this workshop, we want to bring all such applications and approaches developed to incorporate personalization and recommendation in search algorithms.

This workshop to be held with the WebConf 2023 welcomes submissions from academia and industry researchers and practitioners to submit their work related to personalization and recommendations in search. Please note that for the scope of this workshop both personalization and/or recommendations are for improving search experience. Personalization or recommendations as stand-alone topics are out of the scope for this workshop. We also welcome work that can highlight the challenges faced in developing a search algorithm with personalization in real production systems. We invite quality research contributions, including original research, preliminary research results, and proposals for new work, to be submitted as an extended abstract. All submitted papers will be peer reviewed by the program committee and judged for their relevance to the workshop, especially to the topics identified below, and their potential to generate discussion.

*Accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop and will be published in the companion (workshop) proceedings of the WebConf 2023.  We welcome research that has been previously published or is under review elsewhere.  Such articles should be clearly identified at the time of submission and will not be published in the proceedings.*

The topics of interest are (but not limited to) listed below:

   * Personalized query interpretation and intent disambiguation
   * Incorporating user context in real time or in-session adaptation for personalization in search
   * Personalized evidence generation (such as  summary, snippet/TAU, topics, among others) and explainability of search results
   * Fairness and privacy in personalized search
   * Latency, caching and other infrastructural considerations for real-world personalized search systems
   * Lessons learnt and challenges for developing large scale personalized search systems
   * Leveraging different modality of data, including text, image, audio for personalization of search
   * New learning to rank (LTR) approaches for search personalization as well as beyond traditional LTR approaches, such as reinforcement learning for search personalization
   * New applications for personalization and recommendations for search (e.g. in healthcare)
   * Evaluation metrics for personalization and recommendation in search
   * Optimization of delayed user behavioral rewards for personalization and recommendations in search context
   * Human-computer interaction considerations in designing user interfaces and interaction for personalized search
   * Datasets or design of simulator for personalized search/recommendation
   * Personalizations and recommendations for Conversational Assistants
   * Personal search (e.g. email search, desktop search, etc.) is not within the scope of the workshop.
